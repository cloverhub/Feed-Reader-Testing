# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where I come in.

## What did I learn?

I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

# How to run the app

1. Clone the repository or download/extract the zip file to your local machine
2. Open index.html in your browser of choice
3. View the tested specs and failures in the Jasmine section that overlays the page
